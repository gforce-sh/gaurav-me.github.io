# Intro

### What will we learn?
In this workshop we will be learning the basics of React so that we can create a frontend application that can fetch data by consuming remote endpoints, and route to several different pages.

This is the first step in understanding a popular and modern fronend framework, and should set you up to not only be able to create basic applications, but also more easily explore further into frontend development in your own time.
