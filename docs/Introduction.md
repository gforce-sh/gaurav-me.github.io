# Intro

### What will we learn?
In this workshop we will be learning the basics of React so that we can create a frontend application that can fetch data by consuming remote endpoints, and route to different pages. This is the first step in understanding a popular and modern frontend framework, and should set you up to not only be able to create basic applications, but also more easily explore further into frontend development in your own time.

### Who is the instructor(s)?
We're from Credit Suisse APAC Wealth Management Technology. We're part of the team that works on Digital Private Banking software.

### What prior knowledge do we need to have?
You can be completely new to React. However, you will need to know the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, because React is based on the three of them.

### Whats the scope of this documentation?
The purpose of this document is to give you a structured learning platform that you can certainly use during the workshop but also reference after its completion.
