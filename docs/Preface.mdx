# Preface

### What will we learn?

In this workshop we learn the basics of React and related web technologies so that we can create a frontend application capable of

- consuming remote endpoints to fetch data, and
- consisting of multiple pages connected via routes (eg hello.com, hello.com/learn, hello.com/learn/react)

This workshop is the first step in understanding a modern frontend framework, and should set you up to not only be able to create basic applications, but also make exploring further into frontend development more approachable.

### What prior knowledge do we need to have?

You can be completely new to React. However, you will need to know the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, because React is based on the three of them.
