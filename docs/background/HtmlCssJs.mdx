# HTML, CSS and JS

### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

HTML defines the structure of a webpage using a sequence of user-written tags. Every tag has an opening and closing syntax.

```
 <html lang="en">
 <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
 </head>

 <body>
   <h1>Hello!</h1>

   <p>Welcome to this webpage</p>
   <p>You opened this web page on</p>
 </body>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

#### Adding styles to the content

```
 body {
   padding: 50px;
   font-size: 20px;
 }

 .text {
   margin: 20px 0;
   color: blue;
 }

 #time {
   color: maroon;
 }
```

### Javascript

#### Adding logic using vanilla JS

We want to:

- Add the current time to the content
- Display how many seconds have elapsed since the start of the current minute

```
// 1. Find the present time
const currentTime = new Date();

// 2. Find element in DOM and change its text content
var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
var timeParagraph = paragraphs[1];
timeParagraph.textContent =
  timeParagraph.textContent + " " + currentTime.toString();

// 3. Add a new paragraph to tell us the seconds in the current minute
var p = document.createElement("p");
var body = document.body;
if (currentTime.getSeconds() % 2 == 0) {
  p.textContent = `${currentTime.getSeconds()} seconds have passed since the start of the minute. We're on an even second`;
} else {
  p.textContent = `${currentTime.getSeconds()} seconds have passed since the start of the minute. We're on an even second`;
}
p.className = "text";

body.appendChild(p);
```

```

<iframe

  style={{ width: "100%", height: "400px" }}
></iframe>

### What are the issues here?

1. This is an *imperative* approach to writing software. We have to specify line by line what the HTML should look like, and our javascript code is tightly coupled to the HTML layout (e.g. i need to get the second paragraph to do xyz)
2. the tight coupling leads to unexpected breaking changes. If somebody adds a paragraph to the top of the html page, our javascript code with break
3. imperative style is awkward and verbose. we have to reach inside the DOM, get the node, change the node in javascript, and then stick it back in the DOM.
4. Not unit-testable
5. Difficult to modularize. As this app grows, the javascript/HTML file is likely to grow longer and longer.
