# JSX

#### What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It allows us to write HTML-like syntax that transpiles to Javascript objects.

#### How do we transpile JSX to Javascript code and HTML?

✨Babel - `https://babeljs.io/docs/` ✨

#### Time example

We can re-write our application using CSS and JSX:

```
https://codepen.io/grvshrm/pen/KKGYGqE
```

<iframe
  src="https://codepen.io/grvshrm/embed/KKGYGqE"
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "400px" }}
></iframe>

From our example, the following is JSX:

```
const Component = () => {
  const currentTime = new Date();
  const currentTimeInSeconds = currentTime.getSeconds();
  const currentTimeString = currentTime.toString();
  const isEvenSecond = currentTimeInSeconds % 2 == 0;

  return (
    <body>
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p className="text">Welcome to this webpage</p>
        <p id="time">You opened this web page on {currentTimeString}</p>
        <p className="text">{currentTimeInSeconds} seconds have passed since the start of the minute. We're on an {isEvenSecond ? "even" : "odd"} second</p>
    </body>
  )
}
```

#### How is transpilation different from compilation?

- Compilation: Source code converted to another language that has a marked _lower_ level of abstraction.
- Transpilation: Source code converted to source code again, with a _similar_ level of abstraction.

How is this approach better?

1. declarative. we declare (using JSX) what the HTML should look like and React makes it so!
2. Only 1 line of HTML!
3. Ability to use javascript logic makes code less verbose
4. Easy to unit-test
5. Easy to modularize
6. Easy to read ==> Easy to scale and maintain
